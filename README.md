#Digital_Systems Work

In this repo we have mentioned all our work done in our DIGITAL SYSTEMS course.
It inlcudes major assignments and projects as follows:
1. Checked if any number is multiple of decided specific number or not, simulated in Vivado. Also implemented a decoder in Verilog.
2. Created a unique engine which can work for both full adder and subtractor one at a time which will be decided by enable line.
3. Created Synchronous, Asynchronous binary and mod 10 counter and implemented on FPGA.
4. Created digital circuit for array and binary multiplier with a parameterized code in verilog and implemented on FPGA.
5. Created a pattern detector using both mealy and moore FSM logic in Verilog and implemented on FPGA.
